Caryn Johansen- computational biologist

Caryn is interested in how plants respond to their environments, and the changes those interactions can have on populations and genetic variation. She is also interested in gene expression as a quantitative trait.
Maize presents a excellent model organism for these questions, in part due to the amount of genetic information available. In addition,
maize has many landraces with an abundance of different phenotypic traits. 
This is an exciting phenotypic space to explore, and Caryn aims to do so using statistical models to unerstand the relationship between environment and gene expression.
